what sort of stocks would this algorithm use: (always up to be changed)
    - stocks which are active (high volume)
    - this is because this algorithm would benefit from MORE volatile stocks however
    stocks such as pennies may not be ideal as they would either not move at all or move massively, and
    both of these scenarios present the potential for large losses as the spreads would be so large.

what sort of metrics would be used?
    - all metrics have to be discretised in some way or another:
    a metric like RSI is fine because it only has 1000 values (assuming 1dp)
    a metric like price however is not because it can go infinitely up.
    - to discretise a continuous metric like price
        - i can put it in relation to something else such as ema 20: above/below etc.

    - compound metrics?
        - e.g above/below

what timeframe?
    trading at least on an hourly basis to avoid over-imposition of commission costs and because
    at mass certain orders simply cannot be filled in less than 15 mins+

    data can be any size theoretically but I will start with hourly as well
